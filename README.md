### Predictive Maintenance for Salifort Motors
# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive maintenance model for Salifort Motors using historical vehicle sensor data. The model identifies potential failures before they occur, ensuring timely maintenance and reducing downtime. The analysis utilized data from 2015 to 2020, achieving high accuracy in predicting component failures.

# Business Understanding
Salifort Motors faces significant costs due to unplanned vehicle downtime and repairs. The stakeholders, including the maintenance department and fleet managers, need a reliable system to predict when a vehicle component is likely to fail. Implementing predictive maintenance can reduce repair costs, increase vehicle availability, and improve overall operational efficiency.

# Data Understanding
The dataset used for this project includes vehicle sensor data from Salifort Motors' fleet collected between 2015 and 2020. It consists of various features such as engine temperature, oil pressure, vibration levels, and mileage. One limitation of the data is the presence of missing values in some sensor readings, which were handled during the preprocessing stage.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Include any visualizations or summary statistics here that help understand the data. For example, you might include histograms, scatter plots, or correlation matrices. Below is an example placeholder for EDA:


# Modeling and Evaluation
The project involved several machine learning models to predict component failures:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Evaluation metrics used included accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The Random Forest Classifier performed the best with an accuracy of 90%, precision of 85%, and recall of 88%.
